            <h2> The Ohio State University Consent to Participate in Research</h2>
            <p> <b>Study Title: </b>The dynamics of economic decision making<br> </p>
            <p><b>Protocol Number: </b>2013B0583<br> </p>
            <p><b>Researcher:</b> Ian Krajbich<br></p>
            <p> <b>Sponsor: </b> National Science Foundation<br></p>
            <p> <b>This is a consent form for research participation. It contains important information about
                    this study and what to expect if you decide to participate. </b><br> </p>
            <p><b>Your participation is voluntary.</b><br></p>
            <p><b>Purpose: </b> The purpose of this study is to learn more about how people make economic decisions.<br>
            </p>
            <p> <b>Procedures/Tasks: </b>
                You will make a series of decisions that may determine your compensation at the end of the study.
                You may be making decisions by yourself, or with other participants. Your payment
                at the end of the study may therefore depend on your decisions, the decisions of others, and
                chance. You may also be asked to provide basic demographic information and answer some questionnaires.</p>
            <p> <b>Duration: </b><br>
                The total duration of the experiment will be at most 1 hour. <br></p>
            <p> You may leave the study at any time. If you decide to stop participating in the study, there will be no
                penalty to you, and you will not lose any benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.
                Your decision will not affect your future relationship with The Ohio State University.</p>
    
            <p><b>Risks and Benefits: </b><br>
                The risks involved in this study are no greater than those encountered in day-to-day life. You will be able
                to contact investigators at any time during the procedures if you have any concerns or difficulties. There
                are no direct benefits to you from participating in this study. </p>
    
            <p> <b> Confidentiality: </b><br>
                We will work to make sure that no one sees your online responses without approval. But, because we are using
                the Internet, there is a chance that someone could access your online responses without permission. In some
                cases, this information could be used to identify you.</p>
    
            <p>The online services we are using for this study may temporarily store your data, but this data will be
                downloaded and then promptly deleted from those services. </p>
    
            <p> Your data will not be permanently associated with your name, IP address, or any other identifiable
                information (e.g., your information will only be connected to your payment, not to any of your responses),
                though they may be temporarily stored together before we download and separate them. Even so, no guarantee
                of internet survey security can be given because, although unlikely, transmissions can be intercepted and IP
                addresses can be identified.
                The anonymous data may be shared publicly (for example, in conjunction with a resulting academic
                publication).</p>
    
    
            <p> Also, there may be circumstances where this information must be released. For example, personal information
                regarding your participation in this study may be disclosed if required by state law.
                Also, your records may be reviewed by the following groups (as applicable to the research):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Office for Human Research Protections or other federal, state, or international regulatory agencies;
                </li>
                <li>The Ohio State University Institutional Review Board or Office of Responsible Research Practices;</li>
                <li>The sponsor, if any, or agency (including the Food and Drug Administration for FDA-regulated research)
                    supporting the study.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <p><b> Future Research: </b><br>
    
                Your data may be shared with other researchers for future use.</p>
    
            <p><b> Incentives: </b><br>
                Your payment will depend on your decisions, the decisions of others in the study, and chance. Minimum
                incentives are 1 REP credit (for REP students) or $5 (for non-REP students), per hour. Average payments
                range between $6 and $15 per hour, but the actual payments can be lower or higher than these amounts. </p>
    
            <p> By law, payments to participants are considered taxable income. </p>
    
            <p><b>Participant Rights: </b><br>
                You may complete the current study and receive the associated payment, or seek other studies at your
                discretion. </p>
    
            <p>You may refuse to participate in this study without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise
                entitled. If you are a student or employee at Ohio State, your decision will not affect your grades or
                employment status.</p>
    
            <p>If you choose to participate in the study, you may discontinue participation at any time without penalty or
                loss of benefits (although you will not receive payment if you do not complete the study, your account will
                not be debited and there will not be any other penalty). By agreeing to participate, you do not give up any
                personal legal rights you may have as a participant in this study.</p>
    
            <p>An Institutional Review Board responsible for human subjects research at The Ohio State University reviewed
                this research project and found it to be acceptable, according to applicable state and federal regulations
                and University policies designed to protect the rights and welfare of participants in research.</p>
